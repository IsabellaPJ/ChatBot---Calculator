# ChatBot - Calculator
Build a Bot to do basic mathematical operations

## Workflow for the Bot
1. Take two operands and operation as input and show the output
2. Show the available mathematical operations<br>
    • You can use a simple menu based approach to take the operation<br>
    • Example categories : “addition”, subtraction”, ”multiplication”, “division”
3. Based on these input show the output for the users
4. After the flow ends - If a user says ”more operations” , take the new inputs and proceed<br>
    • For example ( let us say user asked for sum of 4 and 5 )
